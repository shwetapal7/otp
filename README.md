To create a simple OTP verification system using Python, you can follow these steps:

Generate a 6-digit random number (OTP).
Store the generated OTP in a variable.
Write a program to send an email containing the OTP.
Request user input for their email address and the OTP they received.
Compare the entered OTP with the stored OTP and verify the user.
